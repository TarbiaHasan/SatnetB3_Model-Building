This study proposes SatNet-B3, a quantized, lightweight deep learning framework that integrates an EfficientNetB3 backbone with custom classification layers to enable accurate and edge-deployable weather event recognition from satellite imagery. SatNet-B3 is evaluated on the LSCIDMR dataset and demonstrates high-precision performance, achieving 98.2\% accuracy and surpassing existing benchmarks.
